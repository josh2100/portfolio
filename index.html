        <strong>About Me</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        Hey, I'm Joshua Schermann! I grew up in Pine River, MN, and moved to
        Minneapolis in 2010. I earned my Bachelor of Design in Architecture at
        UMN. I worked as a Pile Driver for the last 8 years and made site
        layouts, built bridges, buildings, foundations, and assembled crawler
        cranes.
        <br />
        <br />
        I like snowboarding, travelling, hiking, camping, weightlifting, video
        games, and trading stock options.
        <br />
        <br />
        My skills include HTML, CSS, Responsive Design, JavaScript, GitHub. I am
        currently learning MERN stack at University of Minnesota Coding
        Bootcamp.

        <strong>Horiseon</strong> is a Search Engine Optimization website that
        lacked organization and basic Search Engine Optimization. I refactored
        it for an assignment.
        <br />
        <br />
        The file structure was complex, so I simplified it. The starter code had
        broken links and missing alt image descriptions that I repaired. I added
        a meta description and semantic elements for improved readability. The
        CSS file was messy and redundant. I commented and organized it by
        section, and consolidated CSS to eliminate many unneccessary lines of
        code.
