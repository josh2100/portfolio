        <strong>About Me</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        Hello! My name is Joshua Schermann. I grew up on a dairy farm in Pine
        River, MN, and moved to Minneapolis in 2010. I earned my Bachelor of
        Design in Architecture at the University of Minnesota. I worked as a
        Pile Driver for the last 8 years and made site layouts, built bridges,
        buildings, foundations, and assembled crawler cranes.
        <br />
        <br />
        I live in Coon Rapids, MN. I like snowboarding, travelling, hiking,
        camping, weightlifting, video games, and trading stock options.
        <br />
        <br />
        I started studying programming in April 2021. My skills include HTML,
        CSS, Responsive Design, JavaScript, GitHub. I am currently learning MERN
        stack with the University of Minnesota Coding Bootcamp.

        <strong>Horiseon</strong> is a Search Engine Optimization website that
        lacked organization and basic Search Engine Optimization. I refactored
        it for an assignment.
        <br />
        <br />
        The file structure was complex, so I simplified it. The starter code had
        broken links and missing alt image descriptions that I repaired. I added
        a meta description and semantic elements for improved readability. The
        CSS file was messy and redundant. I commented and organized it by
        section, and consolidated CSS to eliminate many unneccessary lines of
        code.
